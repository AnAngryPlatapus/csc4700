Lake Geneva, Switzerland
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Pause time, could save the world no sweat in a doomsday senario (given it might take me a while to figure it out a good solution)
unlimited ability to procrastinate and the best part is no one would ever have to know I have this super power.
